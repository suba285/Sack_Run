# SackRun

A platformer game made with python and pygame.

Nowhere near completion...

controls:
 - movement (a, d) or (<-, ->)
 - interactions (x)
 - shockwave (z)
 - cards (mouse, q)
 
To run the game you'll need to install python 3 and pygame.

Then run the main.py file.

All .py files and the 'data' folder must be in the same folder for the game to 
work.
